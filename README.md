While creating menu you should keep in mind: [work in progress with this one]

```
item [some text with properties]

line [
    items...
    and properties
]

container [
    line [item, item]
    lines...
    and even more properties
]
```

While line can be suggesting, that it's of height equal to 1 (i should just probably change the name, but line seems to fit in my imagination, so idk),
all the elements have the height attribute, so they can all be in fact 2 dimensional.
